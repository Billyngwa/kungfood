Go, also known as Golang, is an open-source programming language developed by Google. Renowned for its simplicity, efficiency, and strong concurrency support, Go is designed to make it easy to build reliable and scalable software. Its statically typed nature and garbage-collected runtime contribute to robust and maintainable codebases.

When it comes to web development, Go stands out for several reasons:

- **Performance:** Go compiles to native machine code, resulting in fast execution and low latency, which is ideal for high-performance web servers and APIs.
- **Concurrency:** Go's goroutines and channels make it straightforward to handle multiple tasks simultaneously, enabling efficient handling of many web requests.
- **Simplicity:** The language syntax is clean and minimal, reducing the learning curve and making code easy to read and maintain.
- **Rich Standard Library:** Go provides a comprehensive standard library, including powerful packages for HTTP servers, templating, and cryptography, allowing developers to build web applications without relying heavily on third-party libraries.
- **Deployment:** Go produces statically linked binaries, simplifying deployment and reducing dependency issues.

These features make Go a popular choice for building modern web applications, microservices, and RESTful APIs that demand speed, scalability, and reliability.
